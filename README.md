# CDLaTex
This is a modification ( hopefully an improved one ) of the original CDLaTeX
Copyright (c) 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
**AUTHOR:** Carsten Dominik <carsten.dominik@gmail.com>  
**KEYWORD** tex  
**VERSION:** 4.7

## Modifications
** Use ; as math-symbol-prefix, which is much more convient. When the symbol is not in the math-symbol-alist, instead of throwing an error, cdlatex will just insert the prefix and the character faithfully ( this should be a solution for most situations of inserting ; itself )
